# Concept
Here  be concept and technical descriptions of tools and implementations for Assisted Progressive Learning methodology.

## Learning Management System (APL LMS)
Web-service that provides end users with access to learning materials required for achieving various study objectives.

In accordance with Progressive Learning methodology, each one of these individual learning materials represents a single non-divisible study objective. For futher reference we'll call a single study objective such as this along with learning materials associated with it a _node_. 

Service provides not only access to individual nodes, but also the possibility to automatically calculate an ordered set of learning materials required to understand and master skills and knowledge represented in them. Such ordered set is represented as a _learning tree_ where multiple nodes are connected to each other in a way to form a coherent and straightforward learning experience.

From the description of Progressive Learning method:
>3. Form an ordered set of all the knowledge and skills required for achieving the chosen study objective and nothing more;

The main goal of LMS in scope of practicing Progressive Learning is to make this step easier for the learner by offloading the tedious task of collecting and organizing materials to an automated service, as well as gather the thorough statistics to analyze learning process in detail.

## Authoring Tools (APL AT)
Web-service that provides a set of tools for authoring, co-wrighting, versioning, classificating, reviewing and publishing learning nodes.

Such service would allow authors to access single nodes, review and them, participate in discussions, form corrections and suggestions as well as wrighting completely new learning nodes, specifying their objectives, subjects and relations to other nodes.
